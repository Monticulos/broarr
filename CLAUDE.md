# Coding requirements

* Before using any library or framework, look up its documentation via Context7 MCP.
* Use SRP, DRY, KISS and YAGNI.
* Prefer pure functions where practical.
* Avoid excessive comments. Use descriptive function names instead.
* Prefer simple and readable code over performance.
* Prefer long and descriptive variable names to short and concise ones.
* Don't use magic numbers or strings. Assign them to a constant or variable instead.
* Every React component should be in its own folder.
* Test happy paths, error cases and important edge cases using Vitest.
* Prefer to use available Digdir Designsystemet components before native html tags. E.g <h1> -> <Heading>, <p> -> <Paragraph>.
* Use Designsystemet CSS tokens for colors, sizes, border-radius, and shadows.
* After writing code, double check that it follows the requirements.
