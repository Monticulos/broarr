* Before using any library or framework, look up its documentation via Context7 MCP.
* Use SRP, DRY, KISS and YAGNI.
* Avoid excessive comments. Use descriptive function names instead.
* Prefer long and descriptive variable names to short and concise ones.
* Don't use magic numbers or strings. Assign them to a constant or variable instead.
* Every React component should be in its own folder.
* When creating commits, do not co-author by Claude.
* Prefer to use available DS components before native html tags. E.g <h1> -> <Heading>, <p> -> <Paragraph>.
