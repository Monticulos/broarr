## Running the frontend locally

```bash
npm run setup
npm run web
```

The site is served at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## Running the collector

```bash
cp collector/.env.example collector/.env   # add your api keys
npm run setup
npm run collector
```

---

## Collector error handling

Individual source failures (collecting or LLM formatting) are logged as warnings and skipped — collection continues with remaining sources. The run throws at the end if either the manual collecting or Apify pipeline produced zero events, preventing an empty `events.json` from being published.
